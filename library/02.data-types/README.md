# Data Types

A comprehensive list of Python's primitive data types, along with their definitions and examples of use. In Python, primitive data types are the fundamental building blocks for data representation. These are the basic types that hold single values and are built into the language. Below is the complete list:

### 1. Integers (int)
- **Definition**: Whole numbers, positive or negative, including zero, with no decimal points. Integers in Python have unlimited precision, meaning they can represent arbitrarily large numbers limited only by available memory.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  x = 10
  print(x)  # Outputs: 10
  ```

### 2. Floating-point numbers (float)
- **Definition**: Real numbers that include a decimal point, representing approximate values of real numbers. They can be positive or negative and are stored in a format similar to scientific notation.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  y = 3.14
  print(y)  # Outputs: 3.14
  ```

### 3. Complex numbers (complex)
- **Definition**: Numbers consisting of a real part and an imaginary part, represented in the form `a + bj`, where `a` is the real part, `b` is the imaginary part, and `j` denotes the imaginary unit (âˆš-1).
- **Example**:
  ```python
  z = 2 + 3j
  print(z)  # Outputs: (2+3j)
  ```

### 4. Booleans (bool)
- **Definition**: A type that represents truth values, either `True` or `False`. Booleans are a subtype of integers in Python, where `True` equals 1 and `False` equals 0, but they are primarily used for logical operations.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  is_valid = True
  print(is_valid)  # Outputs: True
  ```

### 5. Strings (str)
- **Definition**: Immutable sequences of characters enclosed in single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`). Strings are used to represent text data.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  name = "Python"
  print(name)  # Outputs: Python
  ```

### 6. NoneType
- **Definition**: A special type with a single value, `None`, which represents the absence of a value or a null value. It is often used to signify that a variable has not been assigned a meaningful value yet.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  result = None
  print(result)  # Outputs: None
  ```

### Notes
- In Python, the term "primitive data types" is not strictly defined as it is in languages like Java, where primitive types are distinct from objects. In Python, all types are objects, but the ones listed above (int, float, complex, bool, str, and NoneType) are commonly considered primitive because they are the fundamental built-in types used to represent single values.
- Other built-in types like lists, tuples, and dictionaries exist in Python, but they are composite types (collections of values) rather than primitive types, so they are not included here.

These six types cover all the primitive data types in Python, providing the foundation for working with data in the language. Each example demonstrates a simple assignment, which is a basic way to use these types in Python programming.
