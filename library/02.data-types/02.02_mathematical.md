# Mathematical Operators

## PEMDASLR Priority Rule
In Python, the order of operations for mathematical expressions is governed by a set of rules often summarized by the acronym **PEMDASLR**, which stands for **Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction, and Left to Right**. This sequence defines the precedence of operators, ensuring that expressions are evaluated in a consistent and predictable manner. Below is a detailed explanation of each component in the context of Python's mathematical operators, tailored for developer documentation.

---

### 1. **Parentheses (`()`)**  
- **Definition**: Expressions enclosed within parentheses are evaluated first, regardless of the operators they contain.  
- **Purpose**: Parentheses provide a mechanism to explicitly control the order of evaluation, overriding the default precedence rules.  
- **Example**:  
  ```python  
  result = (2 + 3) * 4  # Evaluates to 5 * 4 = 20  
  ```  
  Here, the addition `2 + 3` is computed before the multiplication due to the parentheses.

---

### 2. **Exponents (`**`)**  
- **Definition**: The exponentiation operator (`**`) is evaluated after parentheses. It raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.  
- **Purpose**: Exponentiation takes precedence over multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.  
- **Example**:  
  ```python  
  result = 2 ** 3 * 4  # Evaluates to 8 * 4 = 32  
  ```  
  In this case, `2 ** 3` is calculated first (yielding `8`), followed by the multiplication by `4`.

---

### 3. **Multiplication (`*`) and Division (`/`)**  
- **Definition**: Multiplication and division operators are evaluated after exponents and share the same level of precedence.  
- **Evaluation Order**: When both appear in an expression, they are processed from left to right.  
- **Example**:  
  ```python  
  result = 10 / 2 * 3  # Evaluates to 5.0 * 3 = 15.0  
  ```  
  The division `10 / 2` is performed first (resulting in `5.0`), then multiplied by `3`.

---

### 4. **Addition (`+`) and Subtraction (`-`)**  
- **Definition**: Addition and subtraction are evaluated after multiplication and division, also sharing the same precedence level.  
- **Evaluation Order**: These operators are processed from left to right when combined in an expression.  
- **Example**:  
  ```python  
  result = 10 - 2 + 3  # Evaluates to 8 + 3 = 11  
  ```  
  Subtraction `10 - 2` occurs first (yielding `8`), followed by addition of `3`.

---

### 5. **Left to Right (LR)**  
- **Definition**: The "LR" in PEMDASLR indicates that operators with equal precedence (e.g., multiplication and division, or addition and subtraction) are evaluated from left to right.  
- **Purpose**: This rule ensures a deterministic evaluation order for operations at the same precedence level.  
- **Example**:  
  ```python  
  result = 10 / 5 * 2  # Evaluates to 2.0 * 2 = 4.0  
  ```  
  Division and multiplication have equal precedence, so `10 / 5` is computed first, followed by multiplication by `2`.

### Operator Precedence Summary  
The following table outlines Python’s mathematical operators, ordered by precedence from highest to lowest:

| **Operator**       | **Description**           | **Associativity**  |  
|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|  
| `()`               | Parentheses               | N/A                |  
| `**`               | Exponentiation            | Right-to-left      |  
| `*`, `/`           | Multiplication, Division  | Left-to-right      |  
| `+`, `-`           | Addition, Subtraction     | Left-to-right      |  

**Note**: Exponentiation (`**`) is an exception with right-to-left associativity. For example:  
```python  
result = 2 ** 3 ** 2  # Evaluates as 2 ** (3 ** 2) = 2 ** 9 = 512  
```

---

### Key Considerations for Developers  
- **Parentheses**: Use parentheses to enforce a specific evaluation order or enhance code readability.  
- **Exponentiation**: Recognize its higher precedence and right-to-left associativity.  
- **Equal Precedence**: Multiplication/division and addition/subtraction pairs are evaluated left-to-right.  
- **Clarity**: While Python’s precedence rules are well-defined, parentheses can prevent ambiguity in complex expressions.

By following the PEMDASLR convention, Python ensures that mathematical expressions are evaluated reliably, enabling developers to write precise and maintainable code.
