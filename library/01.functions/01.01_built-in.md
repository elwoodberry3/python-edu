# Built-in Functions
A sub section of Python’s function landscape.  

- **Functions**: `print()`, `len()`, `round()`
- **Explanation**: Built-in functions are core operations provided by Python’s standard library, available without needing to import any modules. 

They perform fundamental tasks:
  - `print()`: Outputs data to the console for display.
  - `len()`: Returns the number of items in a sequence or collection (e.g., a string, list, or tuple).
  - `round()`: Rounds a floating-point number to a specified number of decimal places, useful for formatting numbers.
